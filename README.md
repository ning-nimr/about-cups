# about-cups

## Introduction/Purpose

This repository hosts a simple, single-page website dedicated to providing information about cups. The project serves as a basic demonstration of a static HTML webpage.

## Key Features/Components

- **index.html**: The main and only file, containing all the HTML structure, CSS styling, and content for the webpage.
- **Static Webpage**: A self-contained website that can be viewed directly in a web browser without needing a backend server.

## How to Install/Set Up

As this is a static webpage, there is no installation required. To set it up locally, you can simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ning-nimr/about-cups.git
```

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Alternatively, you can view the page directly via GitHub Pages if it is enabled for the repository.

## Examples

There are no code examples as the project consists of a single HTML file. The usage is straightforward as described above.
